  "Vague Requirements or Specifications": [
    {
      "text": "The product or service must meet specific technical requirements and standards.",
      "reason": "This is vague because it doesn't specify what the 'specific technical requirements and standards' are. The RFP needs to list these requirements, or reference a document that lists them, to allow bidders to understand the project scope."
    },
    {
      "text": "The project must be completed within a specified timeframe and budget.",
      "reason": "This is vague because the 'specified timeframe and budget' are not actually specified. These details are crucial for bidders to understand the project's constraints and feasibility."
    },
    {
      "text": "The project requires a high level of technical expertise and knowledge in specific areas.",
      "reason": "The phrase 'specific areas' is undefined. The RFP needs to list the specific technical areas for bidders to be able to properly assess if they have the necessary expertise."
    },
    {
      "text": "The bidder must demonstrate experience and capabilities in these areas.",
      "reason": "Similar to the previous item, the 'these areas' referenced are not defined. The RFP needs to make it clear what the 'these areas' refer to. "
    }
  ],
  "Undefined Terms or Metrics": [
    {
      "text": "The bidder must meet specific eligibility criteria, such as experience and qualifications.",
      "reason": "The terms 'experience' and 'qualifications' are undefined. What level or type of experience is required? What specific qualifications are needed (e.g., certifications, degrees)? These details are necessary for determining eligibility."
    },
    {
      "text": "The bidder must meet specific financial criteria, such as net worth and revenue.",
      "reason": "While 'net worth' and 'revenue' are somewhat defined terms, the 'specific' criteria are missing. What are the minimum net worth and revenue requirements? Without these figures, bidders cannot determine if they qualify."
    },
    {
      "text": "The bidder must provide a detailed design and implementation plan, including timelines and milestones.",
      "reason": "The terms 'detailed' needs specification. What level of detail is expected in the design, implementation plan, timelines and milestones? The RFP should specify the minimum requirements."
    }
  ],
  "Missing Critical Details": [
    {
      "text": "The project must be completed within a specified timeframe and budget.",
      "reason": "The document does not state the timeframe and budget, so potential bidders can't evaluate if they can actually meet the requirements of the project."
    },
    {
      "text": "The project involves the use of specialized tools and equipment, which the bidder must provide or make available.",
      "reason": "The specific tools and equipment needed are not listed. Without this information, bidders cannot assess whether they have or can obtain the necessary resources."
    },
     {
      "text": "The proposal must be submitted by a specified deadline.",
      "reason": "The RFP omits the deadline, which is a critical piece of information for all potential bidders."
    }
  ],
  "Unclear Expectations or Deliverables": [
     {
      "text": "The bidder must provide a detailed design and implementation plan...",
      "reason": "While the text mentions 'design' and 'implementation plan', the RFP is unclear on what the deliverables should be. What should the final product be? Should the plan include a prototype, a user guide, or other specific deliverables?"
    }
