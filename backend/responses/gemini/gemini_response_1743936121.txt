The Hazelwood School District requires a minimum of 25% MBE and 5% WBE participation in all construction projects.  Proposals not meeting these goals may be rejected.  MBE/WBE firms must be certified by specified agencies (City of St. Louis, SLMSDC, MRCC, state certifications, NMSDC, WBENC, and affiliates) by the proposal opening date.  Manufacturers may use state purchasing divisions or NMSDC certifications.  The District will pay MBE/WBE contractors bi-weekly for labor costs upon verification of need and documentation.  The Supplier Diversity Program details, including Forms A and B (Subcontractor Utilization and MBE/WBE Subcontractor Solicitation Report), are available at www.hazelwoodschools.org.

Key terms include MBE (Minority Business Enterprise) and WBE (Women Business Enterprise).  Important conditions include the 60-day non-withdrawal period for proposals and the District's right to reject any or all proposals.  Technical details involve providing client references (at least three) and documentation of OSHA 10-hour construction safety training.  Additionally, contractors must provide an affidavit confirming E-Verify usage and comply with Section 285.530, RSMo, regarding illegal worker employment.


Eligibility requires MBE/WBE certification from approved agencies.  Submission guidelines involve completing Forms A and B detailing subcontractor utilization and outlining efforts to engage MBE/WBE firms.  Failure to meet the MBE/WBE participation goals will likely result in proposal rejection.  A bid/no-bid decision should consider the ability to meet the diversity requirements and the costs associated with utilizing certified MBE/WBE subcontractors.  Further, compliance with E-Verify and OSHA requirements is crucial.
