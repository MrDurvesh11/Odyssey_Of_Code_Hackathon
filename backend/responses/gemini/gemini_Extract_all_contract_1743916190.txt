Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided RFP chunk and extract the contract terms you've specified.  Since you haven't provided an actual RFP chunk, I will provide a structured JSON output with placeholder values.  You'll need to replace these with the actual information from your RFP.

Here's the JSON structure:

```json

  "Payment terms": {
    "payment_schedule": "Placeholder - e.g., Net 30, milestones, etc.",

  },

**How to Use This:**

1.  **Provide the RFP Chunk:**  Copy and paste the text of your RFP chunk into our chat.
2.  **I will Analyze:**  I will analyze the text and update the placeholder values in the JSON structure with the actual contract terms.
3.  **Review and Refine:** You should carefully review my output to ensure the extracted information is accurate and complete.  You may need to provide additional information or clarify ambiguous language.
