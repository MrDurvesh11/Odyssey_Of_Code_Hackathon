MBE/WBE firms must be certified by specified agencies (City of St. Louis, SLMSDC, MRCC, state certifications, NMSDC, WBENC, and affiliates) by the proposal opening date.  MBE/WBE participation is a favorable factor and failure to meet these goals may result in proposal rejection.

Compliance with Section 285.530, RSMo, regarding illegal worker employment is also required.  False statements are subject to penalties under section 575.040, RSMo.
* **OSHA Compliance:**  Documentation of OSHA 10-hour construction safety training is required for construction-related aspects of the project.


**5. Submission Guidelines:**

Proposals must be concise (maximum 12 pages excluding attachments and resumes), including a transmittal letter and a 3-page executive summary.  Required attachments include:

* HSD Forms A (MBE/WBE Subcontractor Utilization) and B (MBE/WBE Subcontractor Solicitation).

* Company Identification Form (Attachment 1).
* References and Experience, including all Missouri school districts served (Attachment 2).
* Completed Bid Pricing sheet.
* E-Verify affidavits.
* Completed W-9.

Failure to comply with specifications will negatively impact the evaluation.  All required forms and information must be included for consideration.  Proposals must adhere to specified formatting and content requirements, and all information requested in the RFP must be provided.  The proposal will be evaluated based on responsiveness, understanding of requirements, experience, cost, ability to provide services, project approach, and MBE/WBE participation.  Invoices must include the purchase order number, date of shipment, quantity, price, and items shipped.  The proposer must supply the requested information on the provided proposal price sheet.

**Bid/No-Bid Decision:**  A no-bid decision should be considered if the firm lacks sufficient experience in school district IT audits, fails to meet the MBE/WBE participation goals, cannot demonstrate E-Verify and OSHA compliance, or fails to meet the submission guidelines and formatting requirements.  Careful consideration of the costs associated with meeting the MBE/WBE requirements is also essential.
