This document chunk details requirements for a contractor to work with the State of Missouri, focusing on E-Verify compliance and submission guidelines.  Key requirements include enrollment and ongoing participation in the E-Verify program (www.e-verify.gov),  submission of E-Verify documentation (Employment Eligibility Verification page or MOU), and a notarized Affidavit of Work Authorization (within the past 12 months if previously submitted).  If not previously on file, a completed Box B certification of business entity status (per section 285.525, RSMo) is also needed.  If documentation is already on file (Box C), provide the name of the Missouri State Agency or Public University where it was submitted, the date of submission, and the RFP/RFQ number (if known).

Important terms include adherence to section 285.530, RSMo, regarding unauthorized alien employment.  False statements are subject to penalties under section 575.040, RSMo.  The contractor must meet the definition of a business entity as defined in section 285.525, RSMo.

No specific technical details are provided in this section beyond E-Verify program requirements.  Eligibility criteria are primarily compliance with Missouri's E-Verify and business entity statutes.

Submission guidelines mandate inclusion of HSD Forms A and B (MBE/WBE subcontractor utilization and solicitation), a proposal response sheet, E-Verify affidavits, a completed W-9, the Agreement for Contracted Services, and the RFP proposal itself.  Failure to provide all required documents will likely result in disqualification.  The successful bidder will be required to sign a contract per proposal specifications.  Compensation details are included in a separate contract section but limited to a maximum amount per unit.
