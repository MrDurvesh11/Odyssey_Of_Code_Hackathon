  "bid_recommendation": "Do Not Proceed",
  "confidence": 9,
  "key_reasons": [
    "RFP requires MBE certification, and FirstStaff Workforce Solutions, LLC is not MBE certified. This is a dealbreaker.",
    "Significant contract risks present, requiring extensive negotiation that may not be feasible given the dealbreaker and time constraints.",
    "Moderate strategic fit; the company's strengths align with some aspects of the RFP but are not a perfect match."
  ],
  "risk_assessment": {
    "overall_risk_level": "High",
    "explanation": "The primary driver for the high-risk assessment is the inability to meet the mandatory MBE certification, rendering the company ineligible. Additionally, the identified contract risks (payment terms, liability, termination, IP, insurance, data privacy, performance guarantees, and SLAs) require significant negotiation. Even if those issues are mitigated, the fundamental ineligibility remains."
  },
  "next_steps": [
    "Immediately confirm the MBE certification requirement with the RFP issuer.",
    "If the MBE certification requirement is absolute and cannot be waived, do not proceed with the bid preparation.",
    "Review the RFP to see if any subcontracting opportunities may be available for portions of the project.",
    "If there are subcontracting opportunities, and if the project aligns strategically, consider engaging with MBE-certified partners to potentially bid on a portion of the work."
