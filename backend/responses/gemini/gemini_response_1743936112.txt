This RFP outlines requirements for a comprehensive information technology audit of a school district.  Key specifications include assessing the current technology landscape (hardware, software, network, classroom integration, special programs), device management and refresh planning (inventory, refresh cycles, TCO), infrastructure and network evaluation (security, data protection, lifecycle), professional development assessment (training effectiveness, support mechanisms), and technical support and maintenance evaluation (help desk, repair processes).  The audit should cover all items or specific items chosen by the bidding firm.

Proposals must be concise (maximum 12 pages excluding attachments and resumes), include a transmittal letter and a 3-page executive summary.  Detailed organizational information, staffing qualifications (including school district IT audit experience), recent project examples (last 5 years), and references are required.  Attachment 1 (Company Identification Form) and Attachment 2 (References and Experience, including all Missouri school districts served) must be completed.  Disclosure of any litigation involving the company's professional services is mandatory.

Important terms include the District's right to negotiate, withdraw awards within 30 days, and resolve inconsistencies in favor of the RFP.  The District may contract with one or multiple firms.  The contract can be terminated for cause with 30-day written notice.  All RFP terms are binding.  Bidders must complete a Bid Pricing sheet. Eligibility requires demonstrating relevant experience, particularly in school district IT audits.  Submission guidelines specify formatting, content, and attachment requirements.  Failure to comply with specifications will favor the District.  A no-bid decision might be warranted if the firm lacks experience or fails to meet submission guidelines.
