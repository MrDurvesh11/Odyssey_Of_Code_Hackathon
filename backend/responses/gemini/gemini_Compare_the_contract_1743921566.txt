      "problem": "Company policies may require confidentiality around its financial information, and disclosing it in detail could compromise competitive advantage or internal cost structures.",
      "risk_level": "Medium",
      "recommendations": "1.  Seek clarification:  Inquire with the RFP issuer on the specific level of detail required.  2.  Negotiate:  Propose providing a summary of costs and pricing, with the ability to provide more detailed breakdowns upon contract award, subject to non-disclosure agreements. 3.   Limit Scope of Information:  Clarify if information needs to be provided for all services or a subset of services.  4. Consider an NDA: Propose a non-disclosure agreement with the RFP issuer to protect the company's sensitive financial information."

      "contract_term": "Liability clauses: The bidder must comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Other contractual obligations: The bidder must comply with all applicable laws and regulations.",
      "problem": "While generally a standard term, this could be problematic if the RFP's scope involves unfamiliar jurisdictions or areas with complex regulatory landscapes. This requires careful legal review to ensure complete compliance and could carry significant financial and reputational risks.",
      "risk_level": "Medium",
      "recommendations": "1.  Legal Review: Have legal counsel review the laws and regulations applicable to the project scope and location.  2.  Assess Compliance: Ensure the company has the necessary internal processes and procedures to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.  3.  Consider Legal Shield:  In areas where the scope covers unfamiliar regions, explore legal protection to limit the companyâ€™s liability."

Other contractual obligations: The bidder must demonstrate experience and capabilities in specific areas. Other contractual obligations: The bidder must meet specific financial criteria, such as net worth and revenue.",
      "problem": "The company may not fully meet every requirement as stated in the RFP, whether financial, experience, or qualifications. It is essential to properly evaluate the requirements of the RFP and determine if these can be met.",
      "risk_level": "Medium",
      "recommendations": "1.  Gap Analysis:  Perform a gap analysis to identify any requirements the company doesn't currently meet. 2.  Mitigation:  If the company does not meet all requirements, clarify what can be met, highlight areas in which it excels, and emphasize how the company can adapt to meet all needs.  3.  Clarification:  Request clarifications from the RFP issuer regarding the importance of each criteria and how it is evaluated. "

      "issue": "Providing a detailed design and implementation plan, timelines, and milestones",
      "contract_term": "Other contractual obligations: The bidder must provide a detailed design and implementation plan, including timelines and milestones.",
      "problem": "Providing a detailed design and implementation plan upfront can be complex and time-consuming, and could limit the company's flexibility. Without knowing the context of the project, the timeline and milestones may be subject to change, and the company may be locked in.",
      "risk_level": "Medium",
      "recommendations": "1.  Phased approach:  Suggest a phased approach to project planning, providing an outline in the proposal and more detailed plans after contract award. 2.  Flexibility:  Negotiate flexibility in the plan and timelines, including options for revisions based on project developments. 3.  Consider a 'base plan':  If the contract is awarded, provide a detailed design and implementation plan, but specify that the plan is subject to change based on specific circumstances or other considerations."

      "risk_level": "Low",
      "recommendations": "1.  Clarify:  Clarify with the RFP the tools and equipment required and whether the bidder needs to own or provide. 2.  Outsourcing:  If possible, determine if it is possible to outsource the requirement or utilize a third party.  3.  Phased payment:  Ensure that the terms of the contract include a phased payment plan with the potential for the tools and equipment to be covered."

      "risk_level": "Low",
      "recommendations": "1.  Assess needs:  Determine if the company is registered in all required jurisdictions. 2.  Register:  Evaluate how long it will take the company to register in the required jurisdiction, as well as the costs associated with registration. 3.
