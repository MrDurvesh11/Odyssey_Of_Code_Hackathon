  "bid_recommendation": "Do Not Proceed",
  "confidence": 8,
  "key_reasons": [
    "Unfavorable contract terms regarding liability, intellectual property, termination, and governing law.",
    "Significant misalignment in payment terms (Net 30 vs. Net 45) and warranty period.",
    "Lack of Professional Liability insurance and a 24 hour data breach notification",
    "Potential for audits, which could expose confidential information to competitors."
  ],
  "risk_assessment": {
    "overall_risk_level": "High",
    "explanation": "The RFP contains several dealbreakers due to unfavorable contract terms. Specifically, the liability cap at total contract value is too low, the IP ownership terms are disadvantageous, the unilateral termination clause is risky, and the governing law in Delaware and extended confidentiality period are not favorable. The lack of Professional Liability insurance also creates risk. These factors, combined with the unfavorable payment terms and warranty duration, significantly increase the risk profile. The potential for audits adds another layer of risk, potentially exposing confidential information to competitors."
  },
  "next_steps": [
    "Review the RFP requirements in detail to identify opportunities for improvement and assess whether there is room to negotiate the most concerning contract terms.",
    "Assess potential alternative clients, if the risk outweighs the potential reward"
  ]
