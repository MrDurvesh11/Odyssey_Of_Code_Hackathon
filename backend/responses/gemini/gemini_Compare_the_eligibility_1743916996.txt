Okay, I understand.  I need the `eligibility_criteria` from the RFP and the `company_qualifications` to be able to perform the comparison and provide the structured JSON output you requested.

**Please provide the following JSON data:**

1.  **`eligibility_criteria`**:  A JSON object representing the eligibility criteria outlined in the RFP.  Each key should be a descriptive name for the criterion, and the value should be a string describing the requirement.  For example:

    ```json
    {
      "years_in_business": "Must have been in business for a minimum of 5 years.",
      "financial_stability": "Must demonstrate financial stability with a debt-to-equity ratio below 1.0.",
      "past_performance": "Must provide three references demonstrating successful completion of similar projects.",
      "certifications": "Must possess a valid ISO 9001 certification."
    }
    ```

2.  **`company_qualifications`**: A JSON object representing the qualifications of your company.  Each key should correspond to a similar descriptive name to the `eligibility_criteria`, and the value should be a string describing your company's relevant qualifications.  For example:

    ```json
    {
      "years_in_business": "Established in 2018.",
      "financial_stability": "Debt-to-equity ratio: 1.5",
      "past_performance": "Provided references for similar projects.",
      "certifications": "Holds a valid ISO 9001 certification."
    }
    ```

**Once you provide this data, I will generate the JSON output as requested, including:**

*   `overall_eligible`:  True or False (based on whether all criteria are met).
*   `criteria_analysis`: An array of objects, one for each eligibility criterion, detailing the comparison.
*   `missing_requirements`:  A list of any unmet requirements.
*   `recommendations`: Specific, actionable steps to help the company meet the unmet requirements and improve eligibility.

**Example of the output format (after I receive your data):**

```json
{
  "overall_eligible": false,
  "criteria_analysis": [
    {
      "criterion": "years_in_business",
      "meets_requirement": "No",
      "evidence": "Established in 2018.  RFP requires 5 years minimum.",
      "needed_to_become_eligible": null
    },
    {
      "criterion": "financial_stability",
      "meets_requirement": "No",
      "evidence": "Debt-to-equity ratio: 1.5. RFP requires below 1.0.",
      "needed_to_become_eligible": "Reduce debt or increase equity to achieve a debt-to-equity ratio below 1.0."
    },
    {
      "criterion": "past_performance",
      "meets_requirement": "Yes",
      "evidence": "Provided references for similar projects.",
      "needed_to_become_eligible": null
    },
    {
      "criterion": "certifications",
      "meets_requirement": "Yes",
      "evidence": "Holds a valid ISO 9001 certification.",
      "needed_to_become_eligible": null
    }
  ],
  "missing_requirements": [
    "years_in_business",
    "financial_stability"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Company needs to have been in business for the minimum 5 years required by the RFP.",
    "Company needs to take steps to improve the debt-to-equity ratio and drop below 1.0."
  ]
}
```

**Please provide the `eligibility_criteria` and `company_qualifications` JSON data so I can begin the analysis.**
