  "opportunity_assessment": "The RFP presents a significant strategic challenge. The company's core competency is staffing, which is not aligned with the technical IT audit requirements.  This represents a very weak fit. Attempting to bid on this RFP without significant partnerships or subcontracts would likely result in rejection. Without expertise in the required areas the risk is high.",
  "win_strategy": "1.  **Do Not Bid Solo:** The company should not submit a proposal on its own. The gap between the RFP requirements and current capabilities is too wide.\n2.  **Consider a Partnership (Highly Recommended):** Explore partnerships with established IT consulting firms that have proven experience in school district IT audits. This would allow the company to potentially play a role in providing staffing support to the project, leveraging its core competency. This would be the most strategic way to approach this opportunity.\n3.  **Subcontracting:** If a partnership is not feasible, exploring the possibility of a subcontracting role to a firm with the requisite expertise (e.g., providing staffing services for the project) is a possibility but should only be pursued as a secondary option, since it doesn't leverage core competencies as effectively.\n4.  **Focus on Staffing if Possible:** If the company partners or subcontracts, its focus should be on providing staffing for the project, capitalizing on its existing expertise.\n5.  **Detailed Due Diligence (Partnership):** If pursuing a partnership, conduct thorough due diligence on the potential partner to ensure their capabilities and experience align with the RFP requirements and the district's needs.\n6.  **If Bidding, Be Realistic:** If the company does bid, even in a limited capacity (e.g., staffing), be realistic about its role and clearly define its scope of work. Do not overpromise. Consider a 'no-bid' decision. This is not a good fit.",
