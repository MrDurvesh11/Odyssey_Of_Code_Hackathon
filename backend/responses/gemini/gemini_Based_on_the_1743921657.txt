  "confidence": 7,
  "key_reasons": [
    "Eligibility findings indicate the company is not currently eligible.",
    "Significant gaps exist in meeting mandatory requirements (registration, experience, finances).",
    "The company lacks sufficient company qualifications information.",
    "The potential for high and medium risk clauses."

  "next_steps": [
    "Assess company capabilities against the RFP requirements.",
    "Address eligibility gaps immediately by starting the registration process, seeking necessary licenses, and documenting past performance and financial stability.",
    "Review and address contract risks by seeking clarification or negotiating terms.",
    "If the company decides to proceed, perform a thorough gap analysis and identify mitigation strategies (e.g., partnerships, internal improvements).",
    "Prioritize compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.",
    "Thoroughly analyze the legal and financial implications of the RFP's terms and conditions.",
    "Re-evaluate the 'Do Not Proceed' decision if the company can realistically address the identified shortcomings within the RFP timeline."
