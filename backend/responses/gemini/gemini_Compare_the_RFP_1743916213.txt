However, if the RFP requires expertise outside of these areas, or significant experience with a specific niche, the company might be less competitive.",

    "**Focus on Core Strengths:** Highlight the company's expertise in administrative, IT, legal, and credentialing staffing, along with the Texas licensure and experience in their proposal.",
    "**Address Capability Gaps:** If the RFP requires specialized skills, consider partnering with other firms to create a more compelling offering or explicitly state which aspects of the contract can be delivered by the company and for which aspects they have a collaborative arrangement.",
    "**Demonstrate Past Success:** If possible, supplement the proposal with testimonials or project summaries demonstrating successful past performance, even if not explicitly stated in the data provided.",
    "**Highlight Differentiators:** Emphasize unique selling points like focus, location, and specific services.",
