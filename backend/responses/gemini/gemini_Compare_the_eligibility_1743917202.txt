Okay, I need the following to create the JSON output you requested:

1.  **`eligibility_criteria`**:  The criteria specified in the Request for Proposal (RFP). This should be a structured representation (e.g., a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a criterion and contains fields like "criterion_name", "description" or "requirement_details").  **Provide this data!**  Example:

    ```json
    {
      "eligibility_criteria": [
        {
          "criterion_name": "Years in Business",
          "description": "Must have been in business for at least 5 years.",
          "requirement_details": "Provide proof of registration/incorporation."
        },
        {
          "criterion_name": "Financial Stability",
          "description": "Must demonstrate financial stability.",
          "requirement_details": "Provide audited financial statements for the last 3 years."
        },
        {
          "criterion_name": "Relevant Experience",
          "description": "Must have experience in providing similar services.",
          "requirement_details": "Provide 3 client references with contact information."
        }
      ],
      "company_qualifications": {
        "years_in_business": 7,
        "financial_statements": {
          "audited": true,
          "years_available": 2
        },
        "client_references": [
          {
            "client_name": "Client A",
            "service_provided": "Service X"
          },
          {
            "client_name": "Client B",
            "service_provided": "Service Y"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **`company_qualifications`**:  The qualifications and capabilities of the company seeking to respond to the RFP. This should also be a structured representation. Include all relevant information such as the company's years in business, financial information, experience details, certifications, etc.  **Provide this data!** It needs to be in a format that allows it to be easily compared to the `eligibility_criteria`.

**Once you provide this information, I can generate the JSON output.** I will:

*   Iterate through the RFP criteria.
*   Compare each criterion against the company's qualifications.
*   Determine "Yes", "No", or "Partial" based on the comparison.
*   Provide evidence and suggestions for improvement.
*   Compile a summary to determine the overall eligibility.
