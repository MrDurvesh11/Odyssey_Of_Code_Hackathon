  "overall_position": "Moderate. The company possesses a foundation in staffing services, but faces challenges in directly matching the RFP's focus on IT audits within school districts. Strengths lie in its ability to staff administrative and IT positions, potentially supporting the audit process. Key weaknesses include a lack of specific IT audit experience, limited school district experience, and the absence of past project successes directly relevant to this RFP.",
