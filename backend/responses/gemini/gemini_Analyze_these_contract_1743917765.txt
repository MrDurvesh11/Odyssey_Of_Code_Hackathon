  "high_risk_clauses": [
    {
      "clause": "Contractors must have a strong understanding of the organization's business needs and requirements for the application.",
      "reason": "This clause, without providing the contractor with access to all relevant information and allowing for a period of due diligence, places a significant and potentially unfair burden on the contractor. It assumes a level of pre-existing knowledge that may be unreasonable and could lead to misunderstandings or the contractor's inability to properly scope the project, leading to financial or operational issues.",
      "risk_level": "High",
      "suggestion": "Rephrase this to: 'Contractors are expected to demonstrate an understanding of the organization's business needs and requirements. The organization will provide the selected contractor with access to relevant documentation, stakeholders, and a reasonable period to clarify requirements during the contract negotiation phase.'  This balances the responsibility and provides crucial access for the contractor."
    },
    {
      "clause": "Proposals must include a detailed budget breakdown outlining the costs associated with the project.",
      "reason": "A detailed budget breakdown, especially if rigid, puts the vendor at risk of scope creep or unforeseen costs. This becomes risky if the contract later demands compliance to this initial budget. It is better if the contract recognizes the possibility of change and allows for adjustment.",
      "risk_level": "High",
      "suggestion": "Amend it to: 'Proposals must include a detailed budget breakdown outlining the estimated costs associated with the project.  The parties will agree to a process to account for scope changes that may impact the budget and timeline of the project during the contract's term.'"

  "medium_risk_clauses": [
    {
      "clause": "Contractors must be experienced in software development and have a proven track record of successfully delivering projects on time and within budget.",
      "reason": "While this is a standard and generally acceptable requirement, the phrasing is broad and subjective. 'Successfully delivering projects on time and within budget' is not defined. A failure to define 'on time' or 'within budget' may make this a cause for dispute later. Vendor could incur extra costs if the requirement is not defined.",
      "risk_level": "Medium",
      "suggestion": "Clarify the expectation by adding: 'Contractors must be experienced in software development and have a proven track record of successfully delivering projects on time and within budget, demonstrated by references and project examples. 'On time' shall mean meeting the agreed-upon milestones as defined in the project plan. 'Within budget' shall mean adhering to the agreed-upon budget outlined in the final contract.'"
    },
    {
      "clause": "Contractors must have a team of developers with the necessary skills and expertise to deliver the project requirements.",
      "reason": "This is a general requirement that is okay as a prequalification step in the RFP, but it may be later a liability in a signed contract. The specifics of the project and the particular skills can be complex. If these skills are not well defined, the contractor could be deemed to have not met this requirement.",
      "risk_level": "Medium",
      "suggestion": "In the final contract, this should be more specific. 'Contractor will assign to the project developers with the skills and experience required to complete the software development project, which will include: (list the specific technologies or skills needed). Contractor shall provide resumes of key personnel for approval by the organization.'"
    },
        {
      "clause": "Contractors who are selected for the project will be required to sign a contract agreeing to the terms and conditions outlined in the RFP.",
      "reason": "This clause commits the vendor to future, unknown terms and conditions. The RFP should be more comprehensive or there is the risk that the final contract is not acceptable. The vendor should review all the terms and conditions beforehand. This can lead to legal challenges if there's a dispute.",
      "risk_level": "Medium",
      "suggestion": "Change the language to indicate that the final contract will be negotiated based on the RFP. Ensure the RFP includes all critical contract terms. Suggest: 'Contractors who are selected for the project will be required to negotiate and sign a contract based on the terms and conditions, specifications and requirements outlined in this RFP, including detailed statements of work, payment schedules, and other relevant project terms.'"

      "suggestion": "During contract negotiation, carefully review these clauses."

  "summary": "The RFP presents some risks to the vendor, primarily related to unclear requirements and potentially unbalanced allocation of responsibilities. The vendor should carefully negotiate the final contract, paying particular attention to detailed requirements, budget flexibility, and clauses regarding liabilities and warranties. While many clauses are standard, a thorough review is crucial to mitigate potential financial and operational risks."
